Course 1: 20min, Introduction to AWS Cloud

Cloud computing:
    - Refers to the ondemand delivery of IT resources and applications 
        via the internet.  Used to have to build datacenters based on piques. 
        To little resources, customers suffered.  Overplan and wasted resources.        Cloud computing you can scale up and down when needed. 
    - Planning for change management, capacity, etc has changed. Ensure reliable        coverage in face of disaster. 
    - Reduces risk by being agile.  Agility reduces the cost of change. 
    - AWS Cloud Risk Management
        Being agile, lean and quickly adapt to change. 
        Test often, patch quikcly and respond to incidents with lightening speed        Allows customers to react quickly. 
        Automate software dilivery. 
    - Scalability:
        Use services at your own pace.  Scalability refers to resize resources
        as needed. 
        Service level is on demand. 
        Scalability and reliability. 
    - Agility:
        Increasing speed, ease of experimentation and cultivating innovation. 
    - Data Center Location:
        Facilities are all over the world. 
        Don't need to physically locate your resources where your customers
        are.  AWS does it for you. 
        Less time focused on building our your resources. 
        Cloud computing allows you to experiment quickly, with low cost and
        low risk. 
    - Elasticity:
        Power to scale computing resources up or down easily. 
        AWS cloud is elastic.  Instantly scale up or down. 
        AWS Tools "Auto Scalling & Load Balancing"
    - Reliability:
        Ability of an infrastructure to recover from a disaster or failures
        to mitigate distruptions.
    - AWS Regions
        Separate georgraphic locations w/ availability zones. 
        Zones are descrete data centers. 
        Use availability zones, fault tolerant and scalable. 
        Location of zones directly related to fault tolerance. 
    - Security
        Top priority.
        You maintain control over your data.  You hold the encryption keys
        and provide access. 
        You can monitor your IT resources in real time. 
        Multifactor access. 
        Physical security on premisses.
        Your security policy can be built into AWS platform.

Course 2:  AWS Interfacing
Blaine Sundrud

Learn how to access and use resources. 
    1.) Use AWS Management console - aws gui
    2.) Use command line interface - access service via descrete command 
    3.) Sotware Development kits - Utilize API's in your code

    Console:
        Facilitate all aspects of AWS accounts (Security, accounts, services, 
        spend). 
        You can personalize your experience by creating shortcuts. 
        Resource Groups:  ?
        Tag editor:  tag keys and values?  What is a tag? 
        Training: can access training via the console. 
        Mobile App - console is available. 
    AWS CLI:
        Open source tool to interact with tools. 
        OS agnostic, apparently can run different os functions. 
        AWS SDKs - Supporting interfaces "infrastructure as code". 
    
    Language specific SDKs - 
        integrate apis into different 
        languages.  Seems like all of their API references. 

    Summary:
        AWS offers three different ways to manage resources.  Console, 
        CLI and SKDs.
